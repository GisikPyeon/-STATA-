*** Outliers in univariate regression
* Sort in ascending order
sort v1

* Bot plotting for identifying outliers
graph box v1
* Labelling the outlying id
gen id= _n
graph box price, mark(1,mlabel(id))

* ssc install extremes; extremes allows the adjustment of the interquantile range
extremes price returns the lowest and the largest 
extremes price, iqr(1.5) /* by default the interquantile range is set to 1.5 */
extremes price, iqr(3)
extremes price mpg, iqr(3) /* it only returns the extreme values of the first variable */

* Creat a histogram 
histogram price, frequency /* At which range the value is skewed? */ 

* Spike Plot
spikeplot price

* Zscore regards values greater or less than 3 sd as outliers
egen stdprice=std(price)
* List a value 
list id if stdprice > 3 

***************************************************************
* [1] Keep outliers and use non-parametric techniques which are not affected by outliers 
* [2] Correct errors (e.g., data input error)
* [3] Winsorizing means changing the value of the outlying ids with the legitimately closest ones

ssc install winsor2
sum price, detail
winsor2 price, replace cut(1 99) /* replace the value located at 1 and 99% */
winsor2 price, replace cut(5 95) /* change the 99% with 95% value */ 

* [4] Delete the value
winsor2 price, replace cut(5 95) trim /* trim option deletes the outliers */
