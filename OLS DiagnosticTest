kdensity r, normal /* plot the residual */
pnorm r	
qnorm r
iqr r /* The presence of any severe outliers should be sufficient evidence to reject normality at a 5% significance level. */
swilk r	/*  swilk test which performs the Shapiro-Wilk W test for normality. */

* Checking Homoscedasticity of Residuals *
rvfplot, yline(0) /* y = 0 is a reference line to diagnose with the presence of heteroskedasticity */

estat imtest	/*  imest is the Whiteâ€™s test */
estat hettest	/*  Breusch-Pagan */
				/* Therefore it is a common practice to combine the tests with diagnostic plots
				to make a judgment on the severity of the heteroscedasticity and to decide if any correction is needed for heteroscedasticity. */

*** Checking for Multicollinearity
/* The primary concern is that as the degree of multicollinearity increases, the regression model estimates of the coefficients become unstable and the standard errors for the coefficients can get wildly inflated. */
